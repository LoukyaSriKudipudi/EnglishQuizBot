AI Response: This question is about reported speech.

When you report what someone said in the past, you usually change the verb tense.
• Rule: If the reporting verb ("He said") is in the past, verbs inside the quote often change.
• "must" often changes to "had to".
• "now" often changes to "then".

Why the correct answer is B:
• "He said" is past.
• "must" changes to "had to".
• "now" changes to "then".

Example:
Direct: She said, "I am hungry."
Reported: She said she was hungry. (am -> was)
