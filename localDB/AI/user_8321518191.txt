Prompt: Explain this English Grammar question briefly. Clarify the rule or pattern behind the correct answer and give short examples if useful. Use very simple English.

Question:
This time next week, we ______ on a beach in Hawaii.

Options:
A. will be relaxing
B. will relax
C. are relaxing
D. relax

Correct answer: will be relaxing

Keep the explanation brief (<= 1200 characters).
AI Response: This question is about using the right verb tense for future actions.

The correct answer is A. will be relaxing.

The Rule: We use the future continuous tense (will be + -ing verb) to talk about an action that will be in progress at a specific time in the future.

Pattern: "This time next week" tells us a specific point in the future. At that exact moment, the action of "relaxing" will be happening.

Why it's correct:
• "will be relaxing" shows the action will be ongoing.

Why others are wrong:
• "will relax" (future simple) is for a simple future fact or decision.
• "are relaxing" (present continuous) is for actions happening now or planned for the near future.
• "relax" (present simple) is for habits or facts.

Simple Example: Imagine it's Sunday now. "This time next Sunday, I will be having dinner with my family." The dinner will be in progress then.
