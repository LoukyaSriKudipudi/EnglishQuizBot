Prompt: Explain this English Grammar question briefly. Clarify the rule or pattern behind the correct answer and give short examples if useful. Use very simple English.

Question:
Which word is a synonym for 'UNCTUOUS'?

Options:
A. Genuinely kind
B. Sincerely honest
C. Excessively flattering; oily
D. Blunt and direct

Correct answer: Excessively flattering; oily

Keep the explanation brief (<= 1200 characters).
AI Response: This question asks for a word that means the same as "unctuous."

The word "unctuous" describes someone who is too eager to please or is insincerely complimentary. They often come across as fake or trying too hard.
• "Excessively flattering; oily" (Option C) perfectly captures this meaning. "Oily" here means smooth in a way that feels dishonest or insincere.

Let's look at why other options are wrong:
• A. Genuinely kind: This means truly nice, the opposite of insincere.
• B. Sincerely honest: This means truthful, not overly flattering.
• D. Blunt and direct: This means saying things plainly, without trying to please.

Example: A salesperson who is "unctuous" might constantly praise your looks and choices, making you feel uncomfortable because it seems fake.
