Prompt: Explain this English Grammar question briefly. Clarify the rule or pattern behind the correct answer and give short examples if useful. Use very simple English.

Question:
She must be very tired, ______ she has been working for over 12 hours.

Options:
A. but
B. so
C. for
D. yet

Correct answer: for

Keep the explanation brief (<= 1200 characters).
AI Response: This question asks us to choose the word that best connects two ideas.

The first idea is: "She must be very tired."
The second idea is: "She has been working for over 12 hours."

We need a word that shows the second idea is the reason for the first idea.
• "for" can mean "because" when it comes between two clauses. The second part explains why the first part is true.
• Example: He was happy, for he had won the game. (He was happy because he had won.)

Let's look at the other options:
• "but" and "yet" show contrast or something unexpected. This doesn't fit here.
• Example: It rained, but we still went out.
• "so" shows a result. The first idea would be the reason, and the second would be the result. This is the opposite of what we need.
• Example: She worked for 12 hours, so she was tired.

Therefore, "for" is the correct answer because it explains the reason why she must be tired.
